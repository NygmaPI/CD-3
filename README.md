# The Luck of the Irish

(This section is partially taken from Digital Humanities: Tools and Methods (Week 1).)

Jonathan Swift's _A Modest Proposal_ (available on [WikiSource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Works_of_the_Rev._Jonathan_Swift/Volume_9/A_Modest_Proposal)) is a satirical hyperbole which mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor (who were predominantly Irish Catholic), as well as British policy towards the Irish in general. The history of the Irish people is both long and complicated, but what must be remembered is that for the longest time, the Irish people were a disadvantaged minority.

Thus, I thought it might be interesting to look at how the Irish described themselves in Anglophone literature. Or, in Anglophone spheres in general. Preferably, I would look at the frequency of words used and then sort them by descriptive relevance.

Ideally, descriptive words would be tagged either positive (+1), negative (-1), or neutral (0). Or, perhaps, it might be interesting and/or easier to use _[Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/)_ build-in feature. In general, it would be interesting to use _Voyant_ to visualise the corpus regardless.

## Corpus

As indicated in the Week 1 assignment of _Digital Humanities: Tools and Methods_, I had several ideas on how to select the corpus. One of which was: to "look at the works tagged as 'Ireland -- Social life and customs -- Fiction' on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)." I felt like this was a rather unambigious way to select the works, removing personal bias from the equation.

Because I felt it might also be beneficial to add some more categories, I also used works tagged as "Ireland -- Biography", "Ireland -- Politics and government -- 18th century -- Humor", "Ireland -- Social life and customs -- 18th century -- Fiction", "Ireland -- Social life and customs -- 19th century -- Fiction", "Ireland -- Social life and customs -- Fiction", and "Irish wit and humor".

This choice led to an initial corpus of 45 works.

### Limitations of the Corpus

One of the limitations of this method of selection of the corpus is that the tags can be considered rather arbitrary. There are much more works that have the subject "Ireland", even on Project Gutenberg itself (see: [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/subjects/search/?query=ireland)). As such, the decision to use these particular subjects are rather subjective.

Moreover, it leads to certain authors being overrepresented -- most notable William Carleton. While other authors one might assume would be where, such as W. B. Yeats, are underrepresented or generally excluded.

## Goal

By looking at the frequency of words used -- specifically descriptive words -- I would like to examine if there is a trend in how Irish Anglophone authors, and the Irish people in general, present themselves in literature.

Firstly, I would like to look which words in particular are used. 

Secondly, I would like to see if these words change between the 18th and 19th century.

Moreover, if the corpus is expanded, I would like to look at the difference in descriptive words used by male and female authors, as well as the difference between words used in fictional/satirical works as opposed to biographical texts.
